# Picomite Basic Games for PicoCalc

These are games that I've written in Picomite BASIC for the ClockworkPi PicoCalc.

+ Landmine - Drive your tank to rescue civilians on a battlefield riddled with mines.
+ Life - John Conway's classic The Game of Life.
+ PicoMaze - Obtain the Arbitrary Whatsit of Completion in this simple dungeon crawl with plenty of monsters.
+ Rebound - Is it pinball? Is it Pong? This is my attempt to redeem the barely-interactive TI-99/4A game Zero Zap.
+ RoboWorld 2048 - Flee numbered robots that combine when they collide.  Sort of like That One Game meets That Other Game.
+ Snek - Avoid a venomous snake while pushing rocks to trap it. This is my recreation from memory of a similar game included as an example with the NEC PC-8201a portable computer.


Not games:

+ BioRhythm - Debunked pseudoscience to plan your life around!
+ PicoFile - A simple database.
